# Machine-learning-_Financial-Classification-problem


The objective of this report is to make predictions on a financial classification problem and find significant factors contributing to the accuracy rate of models. We conducted PCA for dimension reduction and utilized feature selections approach respectively before implementing machine learning models. Our main goal is to compare the model performance based on these two different settings. Classification algorithms used in such analysis included Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, Logistics Regression and Gradient Boosting Decision Tree with parameters tuning.
